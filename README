	Colors and Highlight
	-> to use a other scheme change the scripts.vim file by editing the colorscheme
	-> test around with the color/*.vim files to get your own colorscheme
	

	Update
	-> if you update the syntax/openfoam.vim file you can sent me your extension lines
	   so that I can implement it on the files :)

	
	Keep foaming
